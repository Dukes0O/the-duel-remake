# ARS-03: Arsenal wave three

4 October 2026. Source built; final reviews and gates pending.

## Decisions Before Code

Use the native weapon trigger, cooldowns, damage, targeting and car effects.
Both arsenal switches and the discovered career gate are entry rules.
Wave three has its own dev switch. Earlier Arsenal weapons stay unchanged.

- Mortar commits the predicted landing point when fired. Its 3 m radius
  red ring stays visible for the full 1.6 s flight. Damage falls linearly
  from 25 at the centre to zero at the edge. The small hop uses the existing
  vertical flight with a 3 m/s launch, scaled by the same falloff.
- Tesla follows its owner's current position during the 0.4 s charge.
  Its 15 m pulse consumes a star shield instead of disabling that car.
  Other hostile cars receive the native disabled effect for 3 s.
- Drone uses the generic active decoy actor and target contract. It follows
  its owner's line, 10 m beside it, for 5 s, with the owner's team. Its first
  hostile hit bursts it; it never fires, scores or pays.
- Nitro uses the native timed effect for 3 s: top speed and acceleration
  times 1.35, crash ram damage times 3. Existing damage ceilings still apply.
  Oil cancels it through the existing counter.

Transient two-hit history stays outside serialized race and save data.
Wave-three computer decisions use the ranges in docs/ARSENAL.md.
Mirage's existing boss file is reused through its generic decoy contract.

## Checks

- Independent native acceptance: 51 cases, 304 checks pass. Includes real
  Crossbow/RPG flights, reward guards, CPU decisions, both gates and levels.
- Existing Arsenal runtime: 209 cases, 2,625 checks pass.
- Laptop-only browser: 16 captures in high and performance modes pass;
  canvas pixels, renderer purity, native Oil counter, zero console issues.
  Drone's opponent HUD marker is excluded; Mirage's existing labels remain.
- Balance: 30 of 30 main Hard races finish; 12 wins. Naturally seeded CPU
  loadouts use all four weapons. Zero unattributed new weapon cues.
  One new defensive supplement stalled against scenery; legal brake/reverse
  recovery now finishes it in 554.49 s, with a loss. Historical policies
  are unchanged. The complete sample must be rerun on the final gated base.
- Nine sound recipes produce 27 cached CC0 recordings; 31 audio checks pass,
  including native CPU/player Voice ownership for all four new actions.
- Browser audio: 27 decodes; all nine native cues; owned loops end and pause.
  Contrast is 6.56 to 9.95 dB over the engine; overlapping mix peak is 0.8202.
- Pending: source/save/audio reviews, final full balance and frame checks,
  lane gate and build on the final integration base.

The existing unimplemented purchase denial changes only its Mortar input to
an unknown weapon ID. Its refusal and no-write assertions are unchanged.

## Removed

The old Mortar unimplemented-purchase fixture input is replaced; refusal
assertions stay unchanged. Temporary Gunn admission/reward, dev/Preview and
look-only Armory handoffs are excluded. Its separate lane is retained.
