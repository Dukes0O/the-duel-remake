# MACHINE-VIEW

The short board entry controls current state, ownership, dependencies and locks.

`src/machines/view.js`, `camera.js`. Draw a machine from its glb's named nodes, joints moved from state. Cameras: cab, chase, and a free look around the working end. Dust, exhaust, tracks marking the ground, bed and bucket showing their load. Sound cues named, reusing engine, impact and debris banks first: `machine.engine`, `machine.hydraulic`, `machine.dig`, `machine.tip`. Reads state only.

Design: [docs/MACHINES.md](../../MACHINES.md), which wins over [docs/WASTELAND_TOWN.md](../../WASTELAND_TOWN.md). Read MACHINES sections 1, 2, 8 and the section this card names. **No button makes a thing. Real materials, machines and physics, no paperwork. The game will be added to for years: no fixed limits, content in data, and a town saved today loads in every later build.** Pure sim files import no DOM, no Three.js and nothing from `src/app.js`. Stay inside the files named here. Everything is behind `wasteland-town`. Keyboard always works. If something the card needs is missing, write your choice under "Codex decided (Claude to review)" and carry on, unless it touches saves, a released course or a replay, in which case stop and say so. Every player-facing word is plain, in whole sentences, no em dashes. Run the card's own checks and `npm run build`; Claude runs the lane tier and browser checks. Write `docs/changes/<card>.md` with a Removed section, and list exactly what Claude should try in the browser. No Chrome under `codex exec`. Memory-only saves. No network, account or key; a library only if MACHINES section 12 names it.
