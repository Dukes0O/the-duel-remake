# Director decisions

Standing decisions D1-D7 are approved in [SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md), section 15.
This log is for choices the spec does not settle. Record the choice, reason,
and how to reverse it before continuing.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — FND-05 base

- Decision: Build the integration branch from the isolated green foundation
  commit that contains FND-04 and FIX-01..03.
- Reason: The checkout called `master` remains the live game. Its three known
  red suites make it an unsafe branch point for parallel work until these
  repairs land. Keeping it untouched avoids a source reload during a race.
- How to reverse: Move `integration/wasteland` to a later tested `master`
  commit before feature work; preserve the foundation commits as a separate
  branch.
