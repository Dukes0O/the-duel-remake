reaches review, merges, is parked, or is released. Keep the board status
in sync with this log.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — BUG-12 blast guard merged

- Independent review found the `alive: false` traffic guard narrow and the
  new test discriminating. Cherry-picked `2404468` as `558b378`.
- The exact integration commit passed 143 merge suites in 260.38 seconds,
  production build and private High/Performance browser smoke with zero
  warnings/errors. BUG-09 started in the ordered combat lane.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — FND-12 profile install rejected by auto-review

- The playbook's profile example was corrected to the installed CLI's
  separate-file syntax and literal Windows paths. The installed CLI confirmed
  `--profile` reads `$CODEX_HOME/<name>.config.toml`.
- Automatic approval review rejected creating a persistent profile with
  `approval_policy = "never"` and network access. It said the overnight work
  approval did not authorize those exact security-setting changes. No
  profile file was created. Continue in this managed session; FND-12 remains
  open for a later explicit authorization and a copy-only dry run.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — Save fixtures integrated; storage target open

- FND-10 fixture commits `716cfc1` and `ff00d7d` were cherry-picked as
  `d5cc701` and `5a447bd`. Seven historical save shapes passed 246 checks
  on integration. The decimal budget model uses 3.67 MB for one stated case;
  four valid archived ghosts project to 4.08 MB. The card stays building.
- FND-11 backup work started in a separate SAVE lane. No real saves or live
  folder were read or changed.
- FND-12 setup audit found an invalid sample profile and unimplemented
  feel/audio commands. A zero-prompt copy-only dry run is still needed.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — FND-06 runner merged

- Cherry-picked `d127709` and review fix `77bfbc5` as `ee27207` and
  `c434200`. The exact integration commit passed 141 merge suites in 174.19
  seconds, production build, and private High/Performance browser smoke with
  four screenshots and zero warnings/errors. The lane full tier passed all
  146 jobs in 241.64 seconds, below the 15-minute limit.
- BUG-01, POLISH-01 and BUG-12 are now ready. Work is underway in separate
  lanes; the live checkout remains untouched.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — Browser harness and feature switches merged

- FND-08 was cherry-picked as `c8b8ed6`. The integration smoke reached an
  active race in High and Performance, saved four screenshots and found zero
  console errors. The lane's deliberate console error caused the expected
  failure.
- FND-09 was cherry-picked as `f12d7e7`. Its 21 unit checks and private
  Experimental menu scenario passed with memory-only saves and zero browser
  errors. No Wasteland feature is in the switch catalog yet.
- A 1280×800 menu screenshot shows the large title crowding the player row.
  Track this as a UI polish card after the runner gate.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — FND-07 replay fingerprints merged

- Reviewed and cherry-picked replay lane commit `288645a` as integration
  commit `0881f73`. The integration run passed 162 checks for 18 replay cases
  across all 16 events, three frame rates and three repeat runs.
- A disposable physics constant change failed the lane check as expected.
  The traces pin the first 10 seconds; longer outcomes remain in the existing
  campaign and event suites.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — FND-03 old worktree retired

- The old worktree's 22 changed paths were preserved as `4237c2e` on its
  existing branch. Against `7564c7d`, 20 matched and the two differences
  are recorded in `docs/changes/FND-03.md`.
- `git worktree remove` succeeded without force. `git worktree list` no longer
  shows `.codex/worktrees/4555`, and the archival branch remains available.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — Integration opened and foundation cards merged

- `integration/wasteland` opened at d86cf4e from the green isolated foundation.
  FND-04 and FIX-01..03 are included in that base; FND-05 installed the board,
  change notes and role profiles.
- FND-02 moved through cold read, correction, commit and cherry-pick to
  integration as 4ebc906. This served as the first lane-to-integrator dry run.
- FND-01 was cherry-picked as 96f8852. Its private build passed, as did 194
  update-notice checks. Desktop and save-continuity acceptance await release.
- FND-06, FND-07 and FND-08 started in separate lane worktrees. No live release
  or GitHub push has occurred.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — First full suite green

- `node tools/run-tests.mjs` passed 138/138 suites in 836.34 seconds on the
  isolated `codex/wasteland-foundation` branch.
- FIX-01, FIX-02 and FIX-03 are committed as 215c7e5, 08d467c and a116397.
  FND-04 is committed as b746171. All four await integration and release.
- FND-05 setup is in progress. No live game release has occurred.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — Wave 0 board seeded

- FND-04 is committed at b746171 on codex/wasteland-foundation. It has not
  merged into integration or master.
- FIX-01, FIX-02, and FIX-03 passed focused checks; they were committed after
  the full suite finished.
- FND-01 and FND-02 have uncommitted edits. Their live and cold-read checks
  still need to be completed.
- The full suite was running. The integration branch had not been created.
- No release has been recorded from this board.

## Handoff

Review and merge FND-06..08 one card at a time after their gates. Complete
FND-01 desktop and save acceptance during the first release. Keep the live
checkout untouched until the final integration commit passes the full gate.

## 2026-09-22 PDT — BUG-01 arrow-key controls merged

- Independently reviewed UI lane commit `eba94d1` and cherry-picked it as
  `3221765`. The 143-suite integration merge gate passed in 229.08 seconds;
  the production build and private High/Performance browser smoke also passed
  with four screenshots and no warnings or errors.
- A is neutral for steering. Left/Right Arrow steer; D resets chase; W/S remain
  pedals. The trajectory fingerprint stays `cfe859d2a6aea7e9`.
- The live `master` checkout is unchanged. README control text will be updated
  in the release documentation pass.
